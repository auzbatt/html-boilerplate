    <h3> Day 1 - 3: Arriving and Getting Acclimated </h3>
        <p> After a <em>smooth </em> and short flight, I hopped off 
        and walked into MEX full of energy. with the sim card
        in my phone, I was able to use data to call an uber 
        straight to my hostel: Suites DF Downtown.</p>
        <p>Suites DF is <strong> THE </strong> hostel to be at 
            in Mexico City apparently, so I decided to start my trip there
        </p>
